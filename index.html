        <h3>About me</h3>
        <p>I lived as a baby in Arandas, Mexico. My family moved to California when I was 5 years old, and where I began elementary school. We first bunked with my aunt and uncle, until a few years later we bought a small mobile home, where I lived until I was 16 in 2017. We then finally saved enough to buy a "real" house, and I went to college at Chaffey College. After completing my GED, I transferred to Cal Poly Pomona and finished studying Computer Science.</p>
